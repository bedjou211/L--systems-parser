The objective of this Java project is to design and develop an interpreter for L-systems. The interpreter takes input in the form of rewriting rules and produces a 2D (potentially 3D) visual representation of the object generated by simulating the system. The project involves multiple stages, including designing a parser to analyze rewriting rules, implementing a rewriting engine to apply rules sequentially, and finally, incorporating a graphical rendering engine to visualize the end result.
Applications:
The implementation of this L-system interpreter opens avenues for creating realistic and diverse plant models. The project's versatility makes it applicable in various domains such as video game development, animation, and graphical modeling.
Execution:
Navigate to the 'project/dist' directory.
Open a terminal.
Execute the following command: java -jar run.jar.
